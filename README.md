# Cake Shop Skeleton

This repository contains a skeleton of a Next.js application for a cake store.
The project follows a simple Feature-Sliced Design structure and uses TypeScript,
Zustand for state management and Material UI for styling.

## Structure

- `src/pages` – application pages (index, catalog, cart, payment, cakes/[id])
- `src/features` – feature modules (e.g. cart)
- `src/entities` – domain entities (e.g. cake types)
- `src/shared` – shared UI components and utilities

To start developing locally, install dependencies and run `npm run dev`.
